# Cats-Dogs-Image-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-ResNet-in-PyTorch

In this project, I have build a PyTorch image classifier using transfer learning, we will use different ResNet models and compare their losses to select a model which can classify between Cats and Dogs images.

The dataset is hosted at : http://files.fast.ai/data/dogscats.zip
